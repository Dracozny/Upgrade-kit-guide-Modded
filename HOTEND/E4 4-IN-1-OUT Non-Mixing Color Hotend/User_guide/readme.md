### NOTE:
1. The four input channels are the same, it is not necessary to distinguish them.
2. How many colors need to be printed, how many filaments to load to the hotend. That is to say, let the unused hotend channels empty.
3. Do not skip the extruders to load filament, for example, when printing
two colors, do not use extruder#1 and extruder#3 or extruder#2 and extruder#3,
MUST use extruder#1 and extruder#2.
